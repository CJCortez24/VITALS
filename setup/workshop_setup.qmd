title: Cloud Workspace Setup
---

> If you plan to use this repository with the **Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub Cloud Workspace** there are no additonal setup requirements for the Python environment. All packages needed are included unless specified within a notebook, in which case a cell will be dedicated to installing the necessary Python libraries using the appropriate package manager.

After completing the [prerequisistes](prerequisites.md) you will have access to the [Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub cloud workspace](https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/). Follow the link and sign in using your GitHub username and password. After signing in you will be prompted for some server options:

Be sure to select the radio button for **Python** and a size of **14.8 GB RAM and up to 3.75 CPUs**.

To open the JupyterHub and clone the VITALS repository automatically you can use the following link: [https://tinyurl.com/yckery74](https://tinyurl.com/yckery74).

## Troubleshooting

We recommend *Shutting down all kernels* after running each notebook. This will clear the memory used by the previous notebook, and is necessary to run some of the more memory intensive notebooks.

</p>

No single notebook exceeds roughly the limit using the provided data, but **if you choose to use your own data in the notebook, or have 2 notebooks open and do not shut down the kernel, you may get an out of memory error.**  

If you elect to try this on your own data/ROI, you may need to select a larger server size. This will often happen if you are using the last EMIT scene from an orbit. In some cases those can be almost double the size of a normal scene. Please select the smallest possible.
