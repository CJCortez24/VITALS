    "# 1 Finding Concurrent ECOSTRESS and EMIT Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and the Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) instruments are located on the International Space Station (ISS). Their overlapping fields of view provide an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate the compounded benefits of working with both datasets. In this notebook we will show how to utilize the [`earthaccess` Python library](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) to find concurrent ECOSTRESS and EMIT data. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ECOSTRESS** instrument is a multispectral thermal imaging radiometer designed to answer three overarching science questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is the terrestrial biosphere responding to changes in water availability?\n",
    "- How do changes in diurnal vegetation water stress  the global carbon cycle?\n",
    "- Can agricultural vulnerability be reduced through advanced monitoring of agricultural water consumptive use and improved drought   estimation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECOSTRESS mission is answering these questions by accurately measuring the temperature of plants.  Plants regulate their temperature by releasing water through tiny pores on their leaves called stomata. If they have sufficient water they can maintain their temperature, but if there is insufficient water, their temperatures rise and this temperature rise can be measured with ECOSTRESS. The images acquired by ECOSTRESS are the most detailed temperature images of the surface ever acquired from space and can be used to measure the temperature of an individual farmers field.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about ECOSTRESS and its associated products can be found on the [ECOSTRESS website](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [ECOSTRESS product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=ECOSTRESS&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **EMIT** instrument is an imaging spectrometer that measures light in visible and infrared wavelengths. These measurements display unique spectral signatures that correspond to the composition on the Earth's surface. The EMIT mission focuses specifically on mapping the composition of minerals to better understand the effects of mineral dust throughout the Earth system and human populations now and in the future. In addition, the EMIT instrument can be used in other applications, such as mapping of greenhouse gases, snow properties, and water resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about EMIT and its associated products can be found on the [EMIT website](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/) and [EMIT product pages](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/product_search/?query=EMIT&status=Operational&view=cards&sort=title) hosted by the LP DAAC.\n",

We will use the `login` function from the `earthaccess` library for authentication before downloading at the end of the notebook. This function can also be used to create a local `.netrc` file if it doesn't exist or add your login info to an existing `.netrc` file.

    "## 2. Search for ECOSTRESS and EMIT Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Both EMIT and ECOSTRESS products are hosted by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). In this example we will use the cloud-hosted EMIT_L2A_RFL and ECOSTRESS_L2T_LSTE products available from the LP DAAC to find data. Any results we find for these products, should be available for other products within the EMIT and ECOSTRESS collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find data we will use the [`earthaccess` Python library](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess). `earthaccess` searches NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR), a metadata system that catalogs Earth Science data and associated metadata records. The results can then be used to download granules or generate lists granule search result URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `earthaccess` we can search based on the attributes of a granule, which can be thought of as a spatiotemporal scene from an instrument containing multiple assets (ex: Reflectance, Reflectance Uncertainty, Masks for the EMIT L2A Reflectance Collection). We can search using attributes such as collection, acquisition time, and spatial footprint. This process can also be used with other EMIT or ECOSTRESS products, other collections, or different data providers, as well as across multiple catalogs with some modification. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Define Spatial Region of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, our spatial region of interest (ROI) will be the a region near Santa Barbara, CA that contains the [Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve](https://www.dangermondpreserve.org/) and the [Sedgwick Reserve](https://sedgwick.nrs.ucsb.edu/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will create a rectangular ROI surrounding these two reserves as well as some of the agricultural region between. Even though the shape is rectangular we elect to search using a polygon rather than a standard bounding box in `earthaccess` because bounding boxes will typically have a larger spatial extent, capturing a lot of area we may not be interested in. This becomes more important for searches with larger ROIs than our example here. To search for intersections with a polygon using earthaccess, we need to format our ROI as a counterclockwise list of coordinate pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `geojson` file containing the Dangermond and Sedgwick boundaries as a `geodataframe`, and check the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the data."
